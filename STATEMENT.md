# Hotel Booking System - Project Statement

## Problem Statement

In the hospitality industry, managing hotel bookings and generating accurate bills is a fundamental requirement. Small hotels and guest houses often need a simple, efficient system to handle guest check-ins, room assignments, service selections, and billing without the complexity of enterprise-level software.

This project aims to create a basic command-line hotel booking and billing system that can:
- Register guest information
- Allow selection of room types with different pricing tiers
- Offer optional services and amenities
- Calculate total costs based on stay duration and selected services
- Generate a comprehensive booking summary and bill

## Objectives

1. **Simplify the Booking Process**: Create an intuitive interface for hotel staff to quickly register guests and their preferences
2. **Flexible Room Options**: Provide multiple room categories to cater to different budget ranges
3. **Customizable Services**: Allow guests to choose additional amenities based on their needs
4. **Transparent Billing**: Generate clear, itemized bills showing all charges
5. **Easy Implementation**: Develop a lightweight solution that requires minimal technical expertise to operate

## Scope

### In Scope:
- Guest information collection (name, age, gender, contact details)
- Room type selection (Standard, Deluxe, Suite)
- Optional service additions (breakfast, spa, parking)
- Meal plan options (all-inclusive, breakfast-only, none)
- Duration-based cost calculation
- Bill summary generation

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements):
- Database integration for booking history
- Online payment processing
- Room availability checking
- Multi-user/concurrent booking management
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Email/SMS notifications
- Booking cancellation and refund management

## Target Users

- Small hotel owners and managers
- Guest house operators
- Bed & breakfast establishments
- Hotel reception staff
- Students learning Python programming
- Developers looking for a basic booking system template

## Technical Specifications

**Language**: Python 3.x  
**Input Method**: Command-line interface  
**Output**: Text-based bill summary  
**Dependencies**: None (uses only Python standard library)

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, users should be able to:
1. Run the program and complete a full booking workflow
2. Enter guest details and preferences
3. Select from available room types and services
4. Receive an accurate, itemized bill
5. Understand the cost breakdown of their hotel stay

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful if:
- All user inputs are correctly captured
- Room and service costs are accurately calculated
- The bill summary displays all relevant information clearly
- The program handles basic invalid inputs gracefully
- The code is readable and well-structured for future modifications

## Conclusion

This Hotel Booking System serves as a foundational project demonstrating basic programming concepts including user input handling, conditional logic, arithmetic operations, and formatted output. It provides practical value for small hospitality businesses while serving as an educational tool for programming learners.
